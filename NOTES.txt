TODO
====
- Change Icon to double trigger and add repeat arrows
- Figure out how the segments are supposed to work
+ Change the modal dialog box to a pop up ballon
+ Disable repeat-trigger button when capture is started
- Do we really need Session::report_failure()? It seems that was necessary before when it had to signal MainWindow but now it's all internal to the Session
